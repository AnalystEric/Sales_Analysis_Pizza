# Business Insight & Recommendations for the pizzeria
**Based on the given data, we will analyse the information to provide recommendations to the pizzeria to enhance its revenue and order numbers.**
![Daily Trending](https://github.com/AnalystEric/Sales_Analysis---Pizza/assets/127030648/6587ae5a-c9c6-475e-9569-b52b347250c5)
1. Since Friday, Saturday, and Sunday have higher order counts, the pizzeria can consider offering weekend-specific promotions or deals.
2. Monday and Tuesday have slightly lower order counts than the week's latter half. To attract more customers during these days, the pizzeria can consider introducing different promotions, where customers can get extra value for their orders. This could include special offers on family-sized pizzas, combo deals, or discounts on certain menu items during these days.


![Percentage of Revenue by Size](https://github.com/AnalystEric/Sales_Analysis---Pizza/assets/127030648/2fbfd32f-2b0b-4ddc-934e-ab4cf3f4b9a8)
It is evident that Large pizza occupies the highest proportion of the revenue. 
1. The pizzeria can create appealing combo deals that include a Regular or Medium pizza along with sides and beverages. Bundling items can increase the average order value and attract customers looking for complete meals.
2. The pizzeria can develop limited-time pizza creations available exclusively in Regular and Medium sizes. These can spark curiosity and attract customers who want to try something new.

We can observe that the peak time for pizza orders is from 12 to 1 pm and 17 to 19 pm.
1. During the hours between 2 PM and 4 PM, there is a slight decrease in order counts. To enhance revenue during these hours, the pizzeria can consider introducing snack-sized options, appetizers, or beverages. This can incentivize customers to place orders even outside of the traditional meal times.
2. For the hours with lower order counts, such as before 11 AM and after 10 PM, the pizzeria can offer incentives like 'buy one, get one free' deals or discounts. These measures can encourage customers to place orders during these off-peak times.
